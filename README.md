# AI Marketplace

A negotiation game where players interact with AI vendors to negotiate prices for various products.

AI Marketplace is a negotiation simulation game where players:

1. **Browse Products**: View a marketplace of products with initial prices and target prices.
2. **Negotiate with AI Vendors**: Chat with AI-powered vendors to negotiate better prices.
3. **Earn Points**: Successfully negotiate lower prices to earn points.
4. **Unlock New Levels**: Use points to unlock more challenging negotiation scenarios.
5. **Track Progress**: Monitor your negotiation history, points earned, and completed levels.

The game simulates real-world negotiation scenarios with AI vendors that have different personalities and negotiation strategies.
